      <h1>About Us</h1>
      
      <p>
        This sites is all about CRUD operation like creating users, reading or
        called finding users, updating the users if necessary and at last
        deleting the users if the admin or certain users required. This is like
        previously done CRUD apps using PHP and MYSQL. But in case of nodejs it
        takes hard works and somehow better knowledge of javascript and i also
        like to tell my story based on nodejs express and mongoose that i have
        suffered before doing this project. So the story is that i was just
        feeling soo bad like after studying PHP and its sql database i was
        thinking that it will be much more easier to understand mongodb using
        nodejs but it was not as expected despite it takes me alots of time becz
        i can't daily focus on doing nodejs mongoose program i don't know why
        but this happens for long period and like i was doing nothing for 2weeks
        but after long period i found myself useless becz i haven't code for a
        long so unwa ntingly i decide to study this again and this time i work
        hard on it and finally this projects is done and my fear towa rds coding
        mongoose eliminated. So as a suggestion i want to tell you all that
        never leave any programming whenever you feels like i can't do this.
